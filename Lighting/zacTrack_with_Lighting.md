# zacTrack with Lighting
**[zacTrack Documentation](../README.md) `>` [zacTrack with Lighting](zacTrack_with_Lighting.md)**

There are two basic ways of connecting zactrack with a Lighting System.
1. [With a sACN or Art-Net Node](zt_Lighting_Node.md)
2. [With a Lighting Console](zt_Lighting_Console.md)

Note: Although there are several other practices to achieving this, these two methods work universally for any (including basic) lighting controllers.
